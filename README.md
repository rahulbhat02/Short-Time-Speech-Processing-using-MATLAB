# Short Time Speech Processing using MATLAB

This tool can be used to separate the voiced part and the unvoiced part from the audio. It is built with an interactive GUI using MATLAB. The input audio is taken from the user using microphone or can be uploaded by the user. The voiced and unvoiced parts of the audio will be separated and will be stored in the folder. This uses the principle of Zero Crossing Rate and Energy of signal. The Energy of the voiced part will be high and that of the unvoiced part will be low. The ZCR of the voiced part will be low and that of the unvoiced part will be high. Using this principle, the voiced and the unvoiced part of the audio is separated.
